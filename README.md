## Description:

The purpose of this project was to create a website that will allow a user to sign in and search their community for help doing chores and tasks.

## Criteria:

GIVEN that I need help with a chore or task.

WHEN I signup for an account.

THEN I can create a profile.

WHEN I have created a profile.

THEN I can login.

WHEN I have a task or chore that I need help with.

THEN I can create a search for help with that task or chore.

WHEN I see a list of people who can help me with my task.

THEN I can contact them to help me with my task.

## Usage:

When the user is not logged in they will be directed to the home page with some information about the website. In order to use the website the user must create a profile. To do this they will click on the button that says "sign up" in the top right corner of the page. This will direct them to the signup page where they will input their information into the fields and click submit. Once they have created a profile they will be logged in and sent to the search page. On the search page they can specify what they need help with from some categories, provide a description of what they need help with, and provide a location. Once they have filled out the form they can click submit and their post will be added to the database and they will be provided with a list of helpers that they can contact to help them with their task.
